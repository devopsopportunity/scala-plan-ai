# Scala-Plan-AI

Scala-Plan-AI is a project developed using the Play Framework with the Scala programming language. Its goal is to showcase how Scala skills can be applied to create innovative, scalable, and high-performance projects. This initiative marks the first step toward exploring advanced technologies for managing daily tasks and structured software development.

The project aims to build an organizational management application with both dynamic and static menus, daily logs, and interactive elements. The objective is to develop an efficient, user-friendly web app for planning and tracking activities.

## Why Scala? A Strategic Choice
Scala was chosen for this project for several strategic and technical reasons, making it particularly suited for future and innovative projects. Compared to Java and Python, Scala offers a unique balance between:

1. **Power and Conciseness:**
   - Scala combines the robustness of Java with the modern, concise syntax of functional languages.
   - Scala code is often shorter and more readable than Java, reducing the risk of errors and speeding up development.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Designed for distributed systems and large-scale applications, Scala is an ideal choice for innovative and "scalable" projects.
   - Its compatibility with the Java ecosystem allows leveraging established libraries and integrating with legacy systems.

3. **Technical Innovation:**
   - Unlike Python, Scala offers static typing support, increasing robustness and reducing bugs.
   - The combination of object-oriented and functional programming allows writing highly modular and reusable code.

4. **Efficiency in Workflows:**
   - Native integration with tools like SBT (Scala Build Tool) facilitates dependency management and project lifecycle automation.
   - Support for the reactive paradigm, thanks to frameworks like Akka, enables the development of high-performance and resilient applications.

5. **Market Value:**
   - Mastery of Scala demonstrates to HR and business decision-makers an ability to adapt to emerging technologies and a commitment to future-proof skills.
   - Scala is used in big data contexts (Spark) and machine learning, making it a strategic skill for technological trends.

In summary, the choice of Scala is not just a technical decision but a strategic vision to face future challenges with appropriate tools and an innovative approach.

## Project Overview

### Getting Started

Here are the steps to get started with this project:

1. **Install SDKMAN and Scala:**
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
   source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
   sdk install scala
   scala -version
   ```

2. **Create a new Scala project with Play Framework:**
   ```bash
   sbt new playframework/play-scala-seed.g8
   name [play-scala-seed]: scala-plan-ai
   organization [com.example]: com.plan.ai
   play_version [3.0.6]: 
   scala_version [2.13.15]: 
   sbt_giter8_scaffold_version [0.17.0]: 
   ```

3. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   cd scala-plan-ai
   sbt run
   ```
   The project will be available at: [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

4. **Clean up the environment (optional):**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.sbt
   rm -rf ~/.ivy2
   ```

5. **Auto-reloading for rapid development:**
   ```bash
   sbt ~run
   ```
