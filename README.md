# Scala-Plan-AI

Scala-Plan-AI is a project developed using the Play Framework with the Scala programming language. Its goal is to showcase how Scala skills can be applied to create innovative, scalable, and high-performance projects. This initiative marks the first step toward exploring advanced technologies for managing daily tasks and structured software development.

The project aims to build an organizational management application with both dynamic and static menus, daily logs, and interactive elements. The objective is to develop an efficient, user-friendly web app for planning and tracking activities.

### New Task Loading Demo üíª

Today, Christmas Day, the Team added the ability to save tasks in YAML format on the file system using a new protocol for exchanging YAML according to the **RFC 9512 standard** of February 14, 2024. The system now includes a **"Current"** folder to store and manage logs, and if the folder does not exist, it will be created automatically.

Below are the most recent updates:

1. **Log Views**:  
   - **Log Passati**: Displays past logs with a visualizer to help users track previous activities.  
   - **Log Futuri**: Displays upcoming tasks and logs, making it easier to plan ahead.

These new features enhance the overall user experience by making it easier to manage both past and future logs in the app.

Additionally, the following features were introduced over the past week to further improve task management:

This Saturday, the Team developed new functionalities to significantly improve task management and user experience. Among the updates, we‚Äôve added the ability to manage tasks using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Additionally, **three new smart sorting buttons** were introduced:

1. **Standard Time Sorting**: Organizes tasks chronologically for easier tracking.  
2. **Task Distribution Across Workday**: Distributes tasks intelligently across vital hours (9:00 AM - 11:00 PM), ensuring a balanced workload throughout the day.  
3. **15-Minute Block Splitting**: Divides tasks into smaller, manageable intervals of 15 minutes, aiding in micro-scheduling and productivity.

These buttons include **"toast" notifications** that provide immediate feedback. A *toast* is a small, temporary, and non-intrusive notification that appears on the screen, confirming a successful action without disrupting the interface. The interface now also features a **menu** to facilitate navigation and smart task sorting. Tasks can be dynamically rearranged between rows, ensuring efficient alignment based on priority and temporal distribution.

Additionally, a **Save Button** has been added, allowing users to save tasks and activities in YAML format, providing a convenient way to archive and retrieve their schedules.

Here‚Äôs a demo showcasing how these new features enhance task loading and organization:

![Demo](demo_view_activity.png)  <!-- Second most recent feature -->
![Demo](demo_save_1.png)  <!-- Earlier demo -->

This functionality fosters productivity by providing a seamless and intuitive way to manage daily activities within the app.

## Why Scala? A Strategic Choice
Scala was chosen for this project for several strategic and technical reasons, making it particularly suited for future and innovative projects. Compared to Java and Python, Scala offers a unique balance between:

1. **Power and Conciseness:**
   - Scala combines the robustness of Java with the modern, concise syntax of functional languages.
   - Scala code is often shorter and more readable than Java, reducing the risk of errors and speeding up development.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Designed for distributed systems and large-scale applications, Scala is an ideal choice for innovative and "scalable" projects.
   - Its compatibility with the Java ecosystem allows leveraging established libraries and integrating with legacy systems.

3. **Technical Innovation:**
   - Unlike Python, Scala offers static typing support, increasing robustness and reducing bugs.
   - The combination of object-oriented and functional programming allows writing highly modular and reusable code.

4. **Efficiency in Workflows:**
   - Native integration with tools like SBT (Scala Build Tool) facilitates dependency management and project lifecycle automation.
   - Support for the reactive paradigm, thanks to frameworks like Akka, enables the development of high-performance and resilient applications.

5. **Market Value:**
   - Mastery of Scala demonstrates to HR and business decision-makers an ability to adapt to emerging technologies and a commitment to future-proof skills.
   - Scala is used in big data contexts (Spark) and machine learning, making it a strategic skill for technological trends.

In summary, the choice of Scala is not just a technical decision but a strategic vision to face future challenges with appropriate tools and an innovative approach.
